# HAB FAQ
After launching, recovering and writing up a handful of high altitude balloons, I've gotten a ton of email from people asking many of the same questions. This FAQ is mostly a place for me to direct people looking for answers to the common questions one might have when getting started in the hobby.

This should be a living document. If you find any typos or have any good additions, please fork and issue a pull request and I'll merge them in.
